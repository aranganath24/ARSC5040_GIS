## Overview

In this session, we will consider the second major type of GIS data (which we have not yet worked with before): raster data. Raster data is essentially a georeferenced grid, rather than georeferenced points, lines, or polygons. We'll talk about the types of data that are represented with rasters, and the various social-scientific uses of raster datasets. The in-class exercise will give you some practice in visualizing raster data, and exploring how raster and vector datasets can be brought together to generate novel empricial measurements at micro-level spatial scales.
