## Overview

In this session, we will cover vector data (which we were introduced to in the previous session when working with a spatial dataset of country boundaries) more explicitly, and explore the different ways it can be manipulated and analyzed, and the different ways it can be used to inform our understanding of social phenomena. We will also explore some of the practical considerations to keep in mind when working with map coordinate systems. The in-class exercise will give you some practice in carrying out basic vector data operations in R Studio.

*Read* **ONE** *of the following*. *Please pay careful attention to the section in which the geospatial methods are discussed, and consider the following questions: What methods were used? How might you deploy these methods in your own research? Was there anything confusing about the methods section? Would you want to ask the author for clarification on anything?
How could these research be extended in new directions?*
