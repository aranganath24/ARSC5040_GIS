## Introduction

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a digital platform that facilitates the visualization and analysis of spatial data (i.e. georeferenced data that contains explicit information about where attributes of interest are located on the earth's surface). The specialized software, analytical principles, and empirical techniques that comprise Geographic Information Systems are now used in virtually every applied discipline across the physical and natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. 

Over the course of our five weeks together, we will explore how GIS is used in the social sciences. In particular, our goals are to survey existing social scientific scholarship that uses spatial data and GIS methods; encourage you to formulate spatial research questions of your own, or think about how the methods and concepts used in spatial social science might enrich your existing work; and provide you with hands-on experience in working with spatial data and basic GIS methods, with a view towards building a basic knowledge base that can serve as a starting point for more specialized future exploration.  

Given the short time frame of the course, we must necessarily be selective about which topics to cover. Important topics that would be included in a longer course, such as [critical or speculative approaches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15410064/2018/62/1) to spatial research are omitted for lack of time, but it is our hope that the material we do cover will allow you to engage productively with these alternate traditions of scholarship in the future. In addition, while spatial statistics and econometrics play an important role in GIS, our course will not explicitly cover these topics. This is because they are presented in another ITSS mini-course, [Modeling Temporal and Spatial Processes in the Social Sciences](https://www.colorado.edu/cartss/interdisciplinary-training-social-sciences-itss/mini-course-modeling-temporal-and-spatial-processes). You are encouraged to enroll in this course when it is next offered, as a complement to this one.

## Accomodations for Disabilities

“If you need accommodations for a disability, it is recommended that you submit an accommodation letter from Disability Services. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting accommodations is located on the Disability Services website. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu) for further assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions under the Students tab on the Disability Services website.”

Please note that no one is required to self-disclose their disabilities. If you have a disability that is not recognized by Disability Services, please let us know how we can best support your learning.

## Classroom Behavior

“Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so that we may make appropriate changes to our records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct.”

## Honor Code

“All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu; 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the Honor Code Office website.”
